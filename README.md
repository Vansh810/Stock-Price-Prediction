# Stock-Price-Prediction
This repository hosts Python code that predicts stock prices by leveraging historical data and the Prophet library. The script fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, preprocesses it, and utilizes Prophet to forecast future stock prices. The predictions are visually represented alongside historical data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
